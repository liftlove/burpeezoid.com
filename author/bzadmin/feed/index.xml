<p>27-21-15-9 reps for time of:<br />
Row (calories)<br />
Thrusters</p>
<p><em>Men use 95 lb.<br />

<p><strong>Notes </strong>as per games.crossfit.com:</p>
<p>This workout begins seated on the rower with the monitor set to zero calories. At the call of “3-2-1 … go,” the athlete will grab the handle and begin rowing. Once you have rowed 27 calories you will move to the barbell for 27 thrusters, then back to the rower for the round of 21, and so forth. Each time you return to the rower you or your judge must reset the monitor to zero before rowing.</p>
<p>Every second counts in this workout. Your score will be the time it takes to complete all 144 repetitions. There is no time cap for this workout.</p>
<p>This workout ends when the final rep of the thruster is locked out overhead. Time will be recorded in full seconds. Do not round up. If you finish in 9:25.7, your score is 9:25.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br />
• An indoor rower with a monitor that measures calories<br />
• Barbell<br />
• Collars<br />
• Plates to load to the appropriate weight for your division</p>
<p>For each workout, be sure the athlete has adequate space to safely complete the event. Clear the area of all extra equipment, people or other obstructions.</p>
<p>*The official weight is in pounds. For your convenience, the minimum acceptable weights in kilograms are 43 / 29 kg for Rx’d, 29 / 20 kg for Scaled, Masters 55+ and Teens, and 20 / 15 kg for Scaled Masters 55+ and Scaled Teens.</p>
<p><strong>Video Submission Standards</strong><br />
Prior to starting, film the plates and barbell to be used so the loads can be seen clearly. All video submissions should be uncut and unedited in order to accurately display the performance. A second person with a stopwatch should be in the frame throughout the entire workout. Shoot the video from an angle so all exercises can be clearly seen meeting the movement standards.</p>

<p><strong>Workout 15.3</strong></p>
<p>Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 14 minutes of:<br />
7 muscle-ups<br />
50 wall-ball shots<br />
100 double-unders</p>
<p>Men use 20-lb. ball to 10 feet, Women use 14-lb. ball to 9 feet</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-G6Fcm6rqCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Notes </strong>as per games.crossfit.com:<br />
This workout begins with the athlete standing under the rings. At the call of “3-2-1 … go,” the athlete will jump up and perform muscle-ups. Once all the muscle-up reps are complete they will move to the wall-ball shots then to the double-unders. After the last double-under, the athlete will move back to the rings and begin the next round.</p>
<p>Your score will be the total number of repetitions completed before the 14-minute time cap. You will enter your result by the total number of reps completed plus your tiebreak time (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Tiebreak</strong><br />
In this workout, we are using a special tiebreak method. At the end of each set of double-unders, time should be marked. When you submit your final result, your score will be the number of reps completed. There will be another field in which you will enter the elapsed time at which you completed your last set of double-unders.</p>
<p>For example, a male athlete finishes 2 complete rounds, plus an additional 2 muscle-ups for a total of 316 reps. This is his score. During his second round, he finished his 100th double-under at 13:20. In this case he will enter 13:20 as his time in the tiebreak field. This athlete would be ranked above someone who got 316 reps and a tiebreak time of 13:45, but below someone with 316 reps and a tiebreak time of 13:00.</p>
<p><strong>For Masters and Teens,</strong> this workout is completed in reverse order, and their tiebreak time will be the point at which they completed their last wall-ball shot.</p>
<p><strong>For Scaled</strong> options there is no tiebreak.</p>
<p>Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. If you are using a countdown timer, you must convert to elapsed time before reporting your score. For this reason, it is recommended you set your clock to count up.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br />
• Set of gymnastic rings hung so you can successfully perform a muscle-up<br />
• Medicine ball of the appropriate weight for your division<br />
• Wall mark or target set at the specified height<br />
• Jump rope</p>
<p>For each workout, be sure the athlete has adequate space to safely complete the workout. Clear the area of all extra equipment, people or other obstructions.</p>
<p>*The official weight is in pounds. For your convenience, the minimum acceptable weights in kilograms are: 9-kg / 6-kg ball for Rx’d, 9-kg / 4-kg ball for Scaled, Masters and Teens, 6-kg / 4-kg ball for Scaled Masters and Scaled Teens.</p>
<p><strong>Video Submission Standards</strong><br />
Prior to starting, film the measuring of the height of the wall-ball target, as well as the weight of the ball, so the loads and height can be seen clearly. All video submissions should be uncut and unedited in order to accurately display the performance. A second person with a stopwatch should be in the frame throughout the entire workout. Shoot the video from an angle so all exercises can be clearly seen meeting the movement standards.</p>

<p>Josh Bridges might have finished 15.2 at the top of the men’s division standings, but that doesn’t come without a bit of controversy.</p>
<p>In his workout video, many are criticizing Bridges for questionable form, specifically breaking  &#8211; or not breaking – parallel on the overhead squat. It’s pretty hard to tell, especially with the video’s low quality and weird camera angle (not to mention the lack of audio.)</p>

<p>CrossFit HQ has so far deemed Bridges workout as good, leading some to speculate of favoritism among the sport’s elite athletes.  Check out what others are thinking over on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/2yqtn7/josh_bridges_152_video_435/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. What do you think? Rep or no rep?</p>
