				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now you’ve probably heard of the infamous hurdle event at the recently-concluded 2015 OC Throwdown. If not, here’s a quick recap. Warning: your backs and butts might want to close their eyes – if they ever had eyes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/guyHurtsVertebrae.jpg" alt="guyHurtsVertebrae" width="930" height="360" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/guyHurtsVertebrae.jpg 930w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/guyHurtsVertebrae-300x116.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p>In the event, competitors were asked to leap over hurdles 50” and up, causing most of them to come crashing down on the floor. One guy suffered more than others. CrossFitter Blake Bastian (not the one in the photo above) had 3 broken vertebrae, and posted this x-ray photo on his Instagram page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, Kevin Ogar broke his back in the same competition. Hopefully these two incidents will serve OCT organizers – or any competition organizer for that matter – a lesson on safety and programming. As for athletes, learn how to pick your battles. Know your limits and know when to back down from a fight – it might just save your back.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Outside Magazine tweeted a photo of Froning, along with the caption: “There’s no better way to get in shape than to prepare for a triathlon (This guy’ll tell you).” Triathlons are nice and all, but Froning thought otherwise – and he even came back with the best tweet ever! Check it out:</p>
<p>Outside Magazine has since taken down the misleading tweet. Froning, on the other hand, has won again (as always). Never change, Rich Froning, never change.</p>

<p>No it’s not California, the birthplace of CrossFit. Nor is it Michigan, home of CrossFit god, Rich Froning. It’s actually Colorado.</p>
<p>According to real estate site <a href="http://blog.estately.com/2014/05/the-geography-of-american-crossfit-enthusiasm/%20" target="_blank">Estately</a>, Colorado is the state that’s most enthusiastic about CrossFit. Hawaii and Texas, come in second and third place, respectively. The Dakotas, on the other hand, come dead last on the list (someone needs to drink more Kool-Aid). The rankings were based on three criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of CrossFit affiliates per capita.</li>
<li>Percentage of Facebook users in each state expressing interest in CrossFit.</li>
<li>The Google Trends score for each state measuring internet searches for “CrossFit”.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-518" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit.jpg" alt="estately-crossfit" width="655" height="548" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit.jpg 655w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit2.jpg" alt="estately-crossfit2" width="655" height="1250" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit2.jpg 655w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit2-157x300.jpg 157w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/estately-crossfit2-537x1024.jpg 537w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></a></p>
<p>According to Estately, Colorado ranked second in residents per affiliate with one box per 28,325 people. It came in 5<sup>th</sup> when it comes to talking about CrossFit online. As for researching about it online, the state came in first with a score of 100.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia placed first in affiliates per resident, but Facebook users there are not too keen on posting about their WODs on social media. They obviously don’t know the first rule of CrossFit.</p>
<p>Nevada, meanwhile, ranked 12<sup>th</sup> most in online searches for CrossFit, but placed 40<sup>th</sup> for actual CrossFit affiliates. “The state is obviously interested in CrossFit, but just can’t seem to pull the trigger,” the website says. “Maybe it’s scared of injuries, or perhaps it’s just lazy?”</p>
<p>“The most obnoxious CrossFit participants are in Massachusetts a state that came in first for posting about it on Facebook, but is just 17th in terms of actual CrossFit affiliates per resident. That’s a lot of talk, but not much action.”</p>

<p>This past weekend in Denver at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rhinos-and-Unicorns/638963542794100?sk=timeline%20" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><em>Rhinos and Unicorns</em></a> fundraiser for <a href="https://www.barbellsforboobs.org/2014-sixty-two-support-team-barbell/%20" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><em>Barbells for Boobs</em></a>, Ogar surprised a crowd of almost 250 athletes by walking out and greeting them. Cue: applause and tears of joy all around.</p>
<p>In a separate Instagram post, he says that he’s still paralyzed but he’s made progress since the accident: “Before every[one] freaks out I’m using KFO braces, I’m still paralyzed, but able to get up and walk around a bit. #forgotwhattallfeelslike”</p>
<p>If that’s not enough good vibes for you, Ogar’s also learned how to twerk. You’re welcome!</p>

<p>Former <em>Dirty Jobs</em> host Mike Rowe recently did a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2m3avv/i_am_mike_rowe_and_i_cant_seem_to_hold_a_job_ive/" target="_blank">Reddit AMA</a> to promote his new CNN series, <em>Somebody’s Gotta Do It</em>.

<p>Of course, the one question that piqued our interest the most was when one redditor asked Rowe about his exercise routine. His answer was quite simple: Burpees.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mikerowe-reddit-ama-burpees-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-453" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mikerowe-reddit-ama-burpees-1.jpg" alt="mikerowe-reddit-ama-burpees-1" width="978" height="315" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mikerowe-reddit-ama-burpees-1.jpg 978w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mikerowe-reddit-ama-burpees-1-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></a></p>
<p>Spot on, Mike, spot on. Also, I think we just found a new term to call Burpees.</p>

<p>Now that’s what you call an AMRAP! Australian Ironman champion Caine Eckstein recently appeared on the Today Show in New York City to break the Guinness World Record for most pull-ups in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The challenge: beat the previous 24-hour record of 4,182. His score: 4,210 pull-ups in just 12 hours! It was enough to not only get him the record for most pull-ups in 24 hours, but also the previous 12-hour record of 4,020. That’s two records in one attempt!</p>
<p>By pacing himself throughout the 12-hour period, he was able to consistently do one set of six reps every minute for the first 10 hours, before settling on five reps per minute for the last 2 hours.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said, when asked why he wanted to try the record. “I’m up for a challenge really. And I’ve always been sort of good and pull-ups, so why not try for a world record?”</p>
