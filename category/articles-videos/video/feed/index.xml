<p>If you’re thinking of joining, don’t bother. Rich Froning and James Hobbart already did the challenge, finishing it in 4:58 and 8:08, respectively.</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJEPgYKwyHI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>But if you thought Froning already had this won (as usual), 35-year-old CrossFit legend Chris Spealler sent in his entry a day later. It showed him completing the challenge in just 3:57.</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzHAjlf-ZDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Amazing how these guys could do 30 strict muscle-ups in that short amount of time. We’d love to do just even 1 strict muscle-up in under 3:57! Also, pardon the vertical videos. We’re hoping these athletes will soon have video-taking skills as great as their muscle-ups.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself doing Fran. Hard? Definitely. Now imagine yourself doing another round of Fran seconds just after you finished Fran. Puking yet? Most definitely.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what 2014 NorCal Regionals competitor <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blondebrookeence%20" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Brooke Ence</a> did (not the puking part) in this video. Here’s what Heavy Fran+ looks like.</p>
<p>With a running clock, do Fran:</p>
<p>21-15-9<br />
Thrusters (95/65#)<br />
Pull-ups</p>
<p>At 4:00, begin a variation of Fran:</p>
<p>15-12-9<br />
Thrusters (115/85#)<br />
Chest-to-bar pull-ups</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4GAv1iQ26UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>How did Ence fare? She finished the first round of Fran in just 3:14, then took a short breather before doing the second set. As if Fran wasn’t enough torture, she takes a mighty blow to the chin while doing pull-ups (see 8:33 of the video). And yet, she still manages to finish in 8:37.</p>
<p>What a warrior! Not to mention, what a hottie! We’re looking forward to seeing more of Brooke Ence in the future, minus the lump on the chin.</p>
